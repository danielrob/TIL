###### `Object.defineProperty`
Is like a single property proxy, allowing you to intercept a property get _with context_. That last part helped me out of a [pickle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50150554/add-function-to-constructor-prototype-with-method-with-access-to-this-from-const/50151472#50151472). 

###### bits and bobs
- `String.repeat(n)` is handy and `'\u00A0'` is a space  
- You can steal text from a page by selecting all of it copying the highlight and deselecting. `user-select` property. Draggable elements have it as `none` by default.

They allow you intercept object.key accesses and perform actions! [ES2015 Proxies](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/es2015-proxies)

### 22nd

###### today I created: 
[styled-as-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-as-components) I had to remind myself of a bit of prototype / inheritance features of javascript which in this case was useful to avoid loops inside a factory function. 

Thanks to [this medium](https://medium.com/@BrodaNoel/how-to-create-a-react-component-and-publish-it-in-npm-668ad7d363ce) for how to publish.

###### `fetch` accepts `FormData` objects as the body... very nice, even though `FormData` objects are non iterable and somewhat awful in that regard :D.
